# NES
An NES emulator written in Java. The emulator itself is pretty darn accurate. Boasting cycle accuracy and well timed components. It passes most tests I throw at it. It is also one of the fastest java emulators I have used.

Current Test Rom Results as of 0.2.2

Currently supported mappers:

0,1,2,3,4,7,9

These mappers give a good mix of compatibility covering most games for the NES.


System Requirements:

- Minimum 1.0 GHZ dual core for full speed.


Unimplemented (Planned) Features: 

- FDS support

- NSF support

- Significantly tested PAL support (has experimental support)

- Use of controllers as input devices

- Screen Filters (including NTSC, scanlines, etc.)

- Debugging tools such as a memory, name table and pattern table viewers

- Continued optimization to reach goal of 0.86 GHZ as the minimum cpu speed.
